## _Mixed-Messages - Codecademy Project_

### Purpose 

The aim of this project is to design a simple nodejs app that will randomly output mixed messages to the user. 
This version of the program will generate: 

* A random destination the user should travel to next.  
* What local food the user  should try at the destination.
* What activity the user should partake in.
* What famous local attraction the user should see.
